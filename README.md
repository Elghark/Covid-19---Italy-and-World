# Covid-19---Italy-and-World
A visual and data analysis of Covid 19 spread with a focus on Italy


------INTRODUCTION------
VERY IMPORTANT: Interactive plots may not be rendered on github. No problem, download all files on your pc and then run on jupyter

The main file is 'Covid 19- Italy & World' jupyter file.
It can be easily converted into a standard '.py' file by using the built in command 'download as python'  in jupyter notebook.
I personally suggest to keep the jupyter format in order to avoid issues with plotly express plugins.

One last thing: a couple of graphs come with a warning (the '*' sign): for some reason, the first time they are run, they don't show correctly. So the workaround is to RE-load the very first 2 cells (import data) and then RE-run those plots.
